This demo provides a brief look into Metrix News (which is no longer published). As you can see it contained many political topics such as the 2020 election, climate change, and more.

Within each topic, users could find relevant and timely stories from an even balance of news sources along the political spectrum. 

Each story contains a brief glimpse of its contents.
